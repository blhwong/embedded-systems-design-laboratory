Course: Embedded Systems Design Laboratory
Created by: Brandon Wong and Duc Tran

Description:
This directory is a list of labs leading up to our final project of a 5x5x5 LED Cube Equalizer.
Each of these labs recycles the skeletons of starter files created by a UT professor named
Jonathan Valvano. However each of the project modules and interfaces are designed by me
and my partner. Each project directory includes a pdf report which is a reiteration of
the readme, but also includes diagrams, flowcharts, sketches, etc. Each project directories
include a file called "all_c_files" or "all_h_files". These were included for submission 
purposes in our course, the files are no indication in how we actually code. In fact, it is
a uncompileable compliation of all our modularized source or header files. You may reference
the all_files for your convenience if you wish.

These projects implement the Texas Instruments LM3s1968 microcontroller. Our final project,
we created and manufactured a printed circuit board and implemented the LM3s811 microcontroller.
